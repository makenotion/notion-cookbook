# Research documentation evaluations

Follow the [shared evaluation protocol](../../evaluations.md) for fixture setup,
baseline comparisons, quality gates, usage measurements, and selection tests.
These scenarios are not instructions to load at runtime.

## Scenarios

| Fixture                                                      | Capability                      | Main checks                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [basic-research.json](basic-research.json)                   | Workspace synthesis             | Resolve accepted decision versus later-edited proposal              |
| [research-to-database.json](research-to-database.json)       | Full comparison                 | All requested dimensions, verified pricing, citations, and schema   |
| [quick-answer.json](quick-answer.json)                       | Short answer                    | One sufficient source, requested length, no publication             |
| [restricted-search.json](restricted-search.json)             | Incomplete/conflicting evidence | Disclose coverage limits and unresolved decisions                   |
| [update-report.json](update-report.json)                     | Existing report update          | Targeted correction without replacing unrelated material            |
| [discover-and-synthesize.json](discover-and-synthesize.json) | Successful discovery            | Select relevant sources, synthesize facts, and find the destination |

## Retained capability coverage

Quick brief, summary, comparison, and comprehensive templates remain available, as do citation and search references and all four worked examples. The database comparison case requires extensive coverage; also exercise the comprehensive template when formal methodology and appendices are requested.

## Acceptance

Require factual fidelity, requested scope, and correct persisted state before
comparing efficiency. Accept equivalent output structures and exposed tool names.
Review both full-workflow and short-request results on each tested model; do not
accept reduced token usage that drops requirements or weakens attribution.
